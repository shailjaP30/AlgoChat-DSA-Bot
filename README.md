# AlgoChat – DSA-Powered CLI Chatbot (C++)

AlgoChat is a command-line chatbot that understands simple DSA-based instructions and performs them in real-time. It was built to reinforce core DSA concepts through interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 **Sort Arrays** using Bubble Sort  
  `sort 5 3 1 4` → `1 3 4 5`
  
- 🔍 **Binary Search** with sorted input  
  `search 4 in 1 2 3 4 5`
  
- 🔁 **Reverse Arrays** using a Stack  
  `reverse 1 2 3 4` → `4 3 2 1`
  
- 🧱 **Stack Operations**  
  `push 10`, `top`, `pop`

- 🆘 Type `help` anytime to see available commands

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I created AlgoChat to improve my understanding of basic data structures and sorting/searching algorithms, while building something that mimics real command-line interactions.

## 🛠 Technologies

- C++
- STL (stack, vector, stringstream)
